# `<Meta>`

> [Node](./node.md) > Meta

This element is used to denote a collection of elements that extend it as exported data specifically used as meta information about its parent node.

It is important to note that this element is not recognised by any parser and should not be used directly. The [Field](./field.md) element, and all elements that extend it, should be used instead when exporting metadata.
