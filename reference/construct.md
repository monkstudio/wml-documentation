# `<Construct>`

> [Node](./node.md) > [Internal](./internal.md) > Construct

Unlike regular elements, this element will export its value as soon as the node is constructed during the node tree initialisation phase.

This element should not be used directly and is intended to be extended by control nodes that need to be exported before the rest of the node tree. 

 See [Internal](./internal.md) for documentation on configured attributes.
